# PA5-Topological-Sort
 A templated Graph class capable of topologically sorting your plans!

 The makefile is ready for compiling on your Linux machine!

 "make 1" will compile and run input1.data
 "make cycle" will compile and run input-cycle.data

 Create your own dependency list and let the program sort your plans!
 If you had 3 activities where 3 depends on 2, and 2 depends on 1, you would
 write your input file as:
 Activity_1 Activity_2
 Activity_2 Activity_3
 Activity_3
